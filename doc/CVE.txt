   This file is a temporary way to post CVE notifications before
   a release.

   Document the CVE fix info in upgrading.txt. Publishing
   upgrading.txt would push info on the next release not the current
   release.

   So we comment out a reference anchor in upgrading.txt and use that
   comment to extract the section from upgrading.txt into CVE.txt.
   The extracted section gets the same anchor that is in upgrading.txt,
   but is is not commented out.

   Then we add a summary to the list of CVE's in security.txt using a
   :ref: to the anchor. If CVE.txt is part of the build and
   upgrading.txt has a commented out anchor, security.txt entries link
   to CVE.html in the generated documentation.

   In upgrading.txt add a

   .. comment: _CVE-2024-39124:

   before the section for the CVE (use the real CVE number). At the
   end of the CVE section add an end comment:

   .. comment: end of CVE include marker

   Update security.txt with a :ref: to the CVE section. E.G. a
   security.txt references look like:

     * `CVE-2024-39124`_ - :ref:`classhelpers (_generic.help.html) are
    vulnerable to an XSS attack. <CVE-2024-39124>` Requires fixing
    tracker homes.

   where <CVE-2024-39124> is the reference. The same reference anchor
   is present (commented out) in upgrading.txt. In CVE.txt you
   replicate the existing anchor and include to extract the content
   section from upgrading.txt. E.G.

   .. _CVE-2024-39124:

   .. include:: upgrading.txt
      :start-after: .. comment: _CVE-2024-39124:
      :end-before: .. comment: end of CVE

   After building the docs, install docs/security.html and
   docs/CVE.html on the web site. Use the security.html URL
   on the web site to update the CVE report.

   When the release is ready, replace 'comment: _CVE' with '_CVE' in
   upgrading.txt. This makes the anchors in upgrading.txt live.

    Then disable CVE.txt by removing CVE.txt from contents.txt in the
   toctree hidden section. Also add CVE.txt to exclude_patterns in
   conf.py.

   No change needs to happen to security.txt as it's using a :ref: and
   we just changed the location for the ref so sphinx will get the
   links correct.

   Now build the docs and publish to the web site.
